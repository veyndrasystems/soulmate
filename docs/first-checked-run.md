# Complete your first checked run

It verifies what you asked an agent to do and what came back, in the same record.

Follow a change from a completion claim through its check, review, and lead
acceptance. When the check fails, keep the earlier result and continue with a
fresh attempt. The [authority boundary](../REFERENCE.md#authority-boundary)
defines who owns each action; [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) defines what the
local evidence can establish.

## Try the complete example

The new `run submit --event-id` and `run next --text` options in this guide are
source-checkout conveniences pending release. Build this checkout first; the
pinned release installer does not acquire unpublished changes. Building needs
Rust/Cargo; running the example then needs the binary and standard POSIX shell
tools, with no jq, Python, model, or account.

From the Soulmate checkout:

```sh
cargo build --locked
SOULMATE_BIN=target/debug/soulmate ./scripts/demo-checked-work.sh
```

The [executable example](../scripts/demo-checked-work.sh) creates its own
temporary project and always removes it on exit. It writes `message.txt` with
`unfinished`, and the frozen shell check requires `ready`. The first actual
check exits nonzero. A scripted reviewer approves anyway; attempted lead
acceptance is refused. The lead requests rework, and another CLI process reads
the assignment and earlier artifact references. The script repairs the input,
submits a fresh worker document, runs the check again, records a separate review
and lead acceptance, and inspects the final ledger.

Look for these lines, with the resumed assignment printed between attempts:

```text
Attempt 1: host check failed; acceptance refused.
Attempt 2: host check passed; separately reviewed and accepted.
Earlier worker artifact retained; new process reconstructed the assignment.
Scripted fixture complete. No model calls or user-success measurements.
```

This is a scripted fixture, not an agent evaluation or external-user study. Its
shell observes actual check exits; the role documents are simulated. It proves
the exercised transition sequence, not that an arbitrary caller reported a
check honestly or that a host conversation survived. The example is gated in
[CI](../.github/workflows/ci.yml).

For the separate installed-binary self-test and an exportable synthetic evidence
bundle, use `soulmate benchmark` and read the
[proof methodology](value-proof-methodology.md).

## Use your own project

Use the built binary for the commands below. From the Soulmate source checkout,
make its absolute binary path available in this shell before changing directory:

```sh
export PATH="$(pwd)/target/debug:$PATH"
soulmate version
printf 'Project directory: '
IFS= read -r project_dir
cd "$project_dir"
```

Choose a small authorized change and the real command your project already uses
to check it. You or your host will execute that command; review it before
entering it. Git must be available when working inside a Git checkout. Use your
normal version-control checkpoint or backup for product changes. Soulmate
records results; it does not undo product edits.

The following uses a new portable project configuration and the starter
`change` workflow (`lead`, `worker`, `reviewer`, then `lead`). If already
configured, keep that configuration and follow its assignments instead. For
control/state outside the checkout, follow [local mode](onboarding.md#choose-the-storage-mode).

Raw goals, command strings, result documents, and ledgers are private operational
data. Portable initialization creates `.soulmate/` with a Git ignore rule;
review what you share, since an ignore rule is not access control. Before any
real agent work, review `soulmate.json` and the generated profiles. The starter
has empty observe/write/command declarations: set the exact authorized limits
and the host's own permissions before freezing the run. A goal does not grant
permission. See [declared boundaries](../REFERENCE.md#first-run-details).

```sh
soulmate init --mode portable
```

After reviewing the configuration, enter the actual goal and check. Continue in
this same shell; `set -e` stops on failed commands, and `set -C` prevents accidental
replacement of the result snapshots written below. Use a fresh ledger name if
`run.jsonl` already exists.

```sh
set -euC
umask 077
printf 'Bounded goal: '
IFS= read -r goal
printf 'Exact project check command: '
IFS= read -r check_command
test -n "$goal"
test -n "$check_command"
ledger=.soulmate/runs/run.jsonl
attempt=1
soulmate brief worker --task "$goal" --config soulmate.json
soulmate run start change --goal "$goal" --check-command "$check_command" \
  --ledger "$ledger" --config soulmate.json
soulmate check --config soulmate.json
soulmate run next "$ledger" --text --config soulmate.json
```

`run start` prints a checked-run notice on stderr while keeping JSON stdout.
`check` validates configuration; the project check runs later. An unchecked run
is still supported by omitting `--check-command`, but it has no check-result
requirement for acceptance.

### 1. Record the lead's scope

The lead reads the pending assignment and writes a real scope document naming
the intended change, allowed work, acceptance criteria, and check. Enter the
path to that completed document. These commands preserve a private snapshot;
they do not invent the document or its decision.

```sh
printf 'Path to the lead scope document: '
IFS= read -r scope_source
cat < "$scope_source" > .soulmate/artifacts/first-scope.md
soulmate run submit lead "$ledger" --outcome scoped \
  --artifact .soulmate/artifacts/first-scope.md --artifact-root state \
  --config soulmate.json
soulmate run next "$ledger" --text --config soulmate.json
```

Have the native host perform the worker's bounded assignment. It must read the
selected profile and relevant upstream evidence and produce a real result
document describing what changed, evidence, and unresolved issues. See
[host handoffs](onboarding.md#keep-the-host-you-already-use); a printed assignment
alone does not execute work.

### 2. Submit the worker result, then run its check

Run this block only when the worker actually reports `completed`. For a blocker,
submit the permitted `blocked` outcome with its real evidence instead and
inspect the run. Keep recorded files unchanged; product source can be repaired
in a later attempt while its earlier result snapshots stay intact.

```sh
printf 'Path to the completed worker result document: '
IFS= read -r worker_source
worker_artifact=".soulmate/artifacts/first-worker-$attempt.md"
cat < "$worker_source" > "$worker_artifact"
worker_event=$(soulmate run submit worker "$ledger" --outcome completed \
  --artifact "$worker_artifact" --artifact-root state --event-id \
  --config soulmate.json)
check_exit=0
sh -c "$check_command" || check_exit=$?
soulmate run record-check "$ledger" --target "$worker_event" \
  --check-command "$check_command" --exit-code "$check_exit" \
  --config soulmate.json
soulmate run status "$ledger" --config soulmate.json
soulmate run next "$ledger" --text --config soulmate.json
```

The shell captures the successful submission's event ID **before** executing
the frozen command. A failed submission stops this sequence. The command text
and `--target` are explicit; Soulmate does not select the latest submission or
execute the command. Every current worker needs its own qualifying report.
Never supply zero when the check failed or could not run.

### 3. Record the review and lead decision

Have the reviewer inspect the assignment, actual change, worker result, and
check evidence. Enter the path to its real review and its actual outcome
(`approved`, `rework`, or `blocked` for this role):

```sh
printf 'Path to the reviewer document: '
IFS= read -r review_source
printf 'Reviewer outcome: '
IFS= read -r review_outcome
review_artifact=".soulmate/artifacts/first-review-$attempt.md"
cat < "$review_source" > "$review_artifact"
soulmate run submit reviewer "$ledger" --outcome "$review_outcome" \
  --artifact "$review_artifact" --artifact-root state --config soulmate.json
soulmate run next "$ledger" --text --config soulmate.json
```

Follow the returned assignment. Reviewer rework returns to a fresh worker
attempt; increment `attempt` and repeat step 2 after the authorized repair.
Reviewer approval moves to the lead. A failed or missing check still prevents
acceptance even if the reviewer approved. Only proceed with the following block
when the lead is pending and has written its actual decision document. Enter
`accepted`, `rework`, `rejected`, or `blocked` as that decision requires:

```sh
printf 'Path to the lead decision document: '
IFS= read -r decision_source
printf 'Lead outcome: '
IFS= read -r lead_outcome
decision_artifact=".soulmate/artifacts/first-decision-$attempt.md"
cat < "$decision_source" > "$decision_artifact"
if soulmate run submit lead "$ledger" --outcome "$lead_outcome" \
  --artifact "$decision_artifact" --artifact-root state --config soulmate.json
then
  soulmate run status "$ledger" --config soulmate.json
else
  printf 'Decision refused; inspect the run and resolve the recorded cause.\n' >&2
  soulmate run status "$ledger" --config soulmate.json
fi
```

A refusal is not acceptance. If the lead remains pending after a failed-check
refusal, it can write a fresh rework document and explicitly request another
attempt:

```sh
printf 'Path to the lead rework document: '
IFS= read -r rework_source
rework_artifact=".soulmate/artifacts/first-rework-$attempt.md"
cat < "$rework_source" > "$rework_artifact"
soulmate run submit lead "$ledger" --outcome rework \
  --artifact "$rework_artifact" --artifact-root state --config soulmate.json
attempt=$((attempt + 1))
soulmate run next "$ledger" --text --config soulmate.json
```

Repeat step 2 after the worker performs the repair, then obtain a fresh review
and lead decision in step 3. The new submission needs a new captured event ID
and new check. Do not reuse a prior attempt's check or overwrite its documents.
If the reviewer or lead already submitted `rework` in step 3, skip the
lead-rework block and run `attempt=$((attempt + 1))` before continuing with the
pending worker. Do not increment twice.

### 4. Inspect or resume from another shell

```sh
soulmate run status .soulmate/runs/run.jsonl --config soulmate.json
soulmate run next .soulmate/runs/run.jsonl --text --config soulmate.json
soulmate run inspect .soulmate/runs/run.jsonl --config soulmate.json
soulmate run report .soulmate/runs/run.jsonl --config soulmate.json
```

Run these with the same compatible binary in the project directory. `next
--text` reconstructs the recorded goal, pending role, stage/attempt, check
policy, result location, and earlier/current artifact references. Read the
referenced files for their contents. For a terminal run it reports the actual
state and no pending assignment. It does not restore shell variables, spawn an
agent, or recover a host conversation. In a new shell, recover the exact frozen
check and current attempt from this view before continuing; never guess them.
Hosts needing the structured packet keep using default `run next` or `--json`.

Success is an `accepted` run with the current worker's qualifying check and
separate review/lead documents; the earlier attempt remains inspectable.
`inspect` validates recorded history and does not establish current disk parity.
Artifact drift prevents further transitions, so preserve the exact legitimate
recorded bytes. Intentional governing-input changes need explicit
[supersession](../REFERENCE.md#run-and-recovery) where permitted; accepted and
rejected predecessors remain final.

After updating the binary, refresh owned project skills with `soulmate init
--refresh-skills --root .` and reload the host. Keep a binary compatible with
run-event format 3 for checked-ledger rollback. Remove optional hooks before
removing the binary; [removal](../REFERENCE.md#removal) leaves local records and
product changes under your control.
